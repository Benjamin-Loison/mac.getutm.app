				<h2>Windows. Linux. Meet <strong>Apple Silicon</strong>.</h2>
				<p>UTM employs Apple's Hypervisor virtualization framework to run ARM64 operating systems on Apple Silicon at near native speeds. On Intel Macs, x86/x64 operating system can be virtualized. In addition, lower performance emulation is available to run x86/x64 on Apple Silicon as well as ARM64 on Intel. For developers and enthusiasts, there are dozens of other emulated processors as well including: ARM32, MIPS, PPC, and RISC-V. Your Mac can now truly run anything.</p>

				<h2>Designed for <strong>macOS</strong></h2>
				<p>Unlike other free virtualization software, UTM was created for macOS and <strong>only</strong> for Apple platforms. It is designed completely from the ground up for the new style introduced in Big Sur. UTM looks and feels like a Mac app with all the privacy and security features you expect as well.</p>

				<h2><strong>QEMU</strong> without the headache</h2>
				<p>Under the hood of UTM is <a href="https://www.qemu.org">QEMU</a>, a decades old, free and open source emulation software that is widely used and actively maintained. While QEMU is powerful, it can be difficult to set up and configure with its plethora of command line options and flags. UTM is designed to give users the flexibility of QEMU without the steep learning curve that comes with it.</p>

				<h2>What's the difference in the Mac App Store version?</h2>
				<p>UTM is and always will be completely free and open source. The Mac App Store version is identical to the free version and there are no features left out of the free version. The only advantage of the Mac App Store version is that you can get automatic updates. Purchasing the App Store version directly funds the development of UTM and shows your support <i class="fas fa-heart"></i>.</p>

				<h2>How do I contribute?</h2>

				<h2>Can I run games?</h2>
				<p>No, probably not. UTM does not currently support GPU emulation/virtualization and therefore lacks support for 3D acceleration (e.g. OpenGL and DirectX). You may be able to run older games with software rendering options, but nothing with hardware acceleration.</p>
